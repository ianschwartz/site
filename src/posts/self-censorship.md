As a child, I was unafraid to create. I wrote stories and
songs without fear of embarrassment. I can't say when this changed,
but it did, to be sure. There have been a few times when I've written
things that really impressed myself, but most of the time I make myself
cringe. It's possible that all first drafts are cringey, that I should
polish my turds into gleaming gems, but the first cheesy rhyme and I send
myself spiraling.

The irony is that I love lyrics that are unabashedly cheesy. I respect
writers who can write an imperfect line and just move on, rather than
obsessing over each comma until it becomes a masterpiece (or gets too
frustrating to continue).
