I don't want to be one of those complaining old men, constantly
bemoaning every difference that I see between the world of my youth
and that of today.I'm not that old anyway; at 38 I consider myself
to be just barely reaching adulthood.

I have two small children of the girl persuasion, ages 2 and 4.
The pandemic has changed so much about their lives, but one change is that
we all have a lot more screen time than before.

Children's programming is shit today. Boring computer-generated
animation, interchangeable characters with impossibly cheerful voices.
Most of it seems lazy and half-baked. You could take the plots and
characters from any number of shows and switch them around and it
would all fit fine. I'm talking about shows like _PJ Masks_, _Paw Patrol_, and _Mickey Mouse Clubhouse_.

_Mickey Mouse Clubhouse_ is a particularly bad offender, because I have
such strong childhood attachments to the source material. It might be
the worst show ever made. It's weird, but not in a fun way like _Yo Gabba Gabba_.
Completely humorless.

Even _Sesame Street_, of which I am a staunch advocate, uses obvious
filler sketches like [_Journey to Ernie_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TkpZx1dzQ), which is absolute garbage.

Contrast that to the shows I watched as a kid. We've been playing _Fraggle Rock_, _The Elephant Show_, _Magic Schoolbus_, _Beakman's World_, _Bill Nye the Science Guy_. They're just better.

The Fraggles are such well-developed characters, and the show does such a good job of showing the fragile beauty of their ecosystem. There are layers of information that can be gleaned on subsequent rewatches. As children mature, there are jokes and nuances they start to grasp. The show is actually entertaining for adults.

Contrast that to _The PJ Masks_, a show that makes me want to actually put my head through the TV.
