Day 2 of using an ortholinear keyboard is pretty rough. My typing style is less "hands on the home row"
and more "be person who has used a keyboard and just know where all the letters are". On a normal keeb,
I tend to use two fingers and a thumb (per hand) for everything. That isn't possible here, so I'm _mavis beaconing_
the crap out of this keyboard. Typing is very slow.

I'm absolutely loving QMK though, and I can't believe the power is offers. On layer 1 (not 0),
I have set the arrow keys to emit mouse events. I can move the pointer using them as well as left and
right click. Additionally, with all the typos, I got pretty sick of reaching for the `backspace` key, so
I remapped `j` and `k` to work as `backspace` and `enter` respectively. There are a lot of keys I never use,
so I'd like to relegate them to lower layers (I'm looking at you `ins` and `scroll lock`) and use the extra
real estate for macros.

I also split the bottom row, and put a key for toggling between levels in between `b` and `v`.
