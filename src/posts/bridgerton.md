What is to follow is an honest review of the Netflix series
_Bridgerton_. My wife watched the series while I alternately played on
my phone, worked on some code, slept and occasionally I joined her as well. I missed
a lot, and I don't care.

Bridgerton is apparently the story of Daphne, a 21-year-old debuntante, and The Duke,
a rich guy she likes. Early in the series, the Duke pledges to his dying father that he
will never sire children, as revenge for the dad having been so terrible. As someone
who has sired children, this is a perfectly acceptable choice to make. Kids are wonderful
but hard, and if you are worried about perpetuating a pattern of abuse, that makes it
harder. The Duke is also like 25? I also did not want to have kids at 25, although I did
not pledge it on my father's deathbed (something about linear time and his still being
alive and also a great dad).

Daphne and the Duke do not want to court anybody, so they pledge to court each other. They
are young, sexy and really repressed. They are also both whiny bitches. This is very hot
and you are expected to really feel the sexual tension here.
