## [Brownie Cupcakes Recipe](https://www.alsothecrumbsplease.com/brownie-cupcakes-recipe/)

### Ingredients

1 cup butter, melted and cooled (226g)
2 cups granulated white sugar (400g)
4 large eggs
2 vanilla beans* (or 2 tsp pure vanilla extract)
1 cup dutch-processed cocoa powder (84g)
1 cup all-purpose flour (120g)
1 tsp salt

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350°F / 175°C. Line two 12 cup muffin pans with 13-14 cupcake liners. Set aside.

Stir together butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla just until combined. Don't use a hand or stand mixer otherwise you have too much air pockets in the batter, and this makes them cakey instead of fudgy. Stir by hand with a whisk. Sift in flour, cocoa, and salt and stir just until combined.

Spoon batter with an ice cream scoop into the liners and fill almost full.

Bake for 22-26 minutes until the tops look crinkled and a toothpick centered in the middle comes out slightly dirty. Don't overbake them or they are getting cakey. I baked mine for exactly 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Then carefully remove from pan and transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before frosting.
