	C    C 	  C    C7

VERSE 1:
F				C
 	There's a problem growing here
G						C			C7
	She said as the tears started flowing
F			C
 	And I'm beginning to think that it
G
	Comes from you
	F 					G
You've got no lows and you've got no highs
	F 					G
You never laugh and you never cry

	Dm										E7
	Say you love me but I don't think that you can

CHORUS
	F 			C
	You might as well live here
	F 			C
	In my computer cuz
	F 			C 		G 		 C
	You are just a one-dimensional boy 
	F 			C
	You might as well live here
	F 			C
	In my computer cuz
	F 			C 		G 		 C    Dm
	You are just a one-dimensional boy 
	Dm			G7		C 	C7
	That's what you are

VERSE 2: (same chords)
	There's something missing here
	She said, as she stopped him from kissing her
	And I'm beginning to think that it's love

	Your insides are all plain to see
	to a two-dimensional girl like me
	You're living your whole life going in a straight line

CHORUS AGAIN
