INTRO chords: CMaj7    G      x2

VERSE:

  CMaj7
	 I used to know a girl who was afraid of the dark
  G
	 She'd cry when I turned the lights out
  CMaj7
  	 And I'd lie awake all night and stare at the ceiling
  G
  	 Because I can't sleep with them on

     G     G/F#   Am
     "Don't you    know,"
     Am     D7
     Karen says, "that sometimes it
     G 				Em
     Doesn't matter if there's love there
     Am     	   D7
     She's in your head and in your
     G 					Em
     Bed and you can't sleep beside her
     Am    			 D7
     Why should you waste all that
     G 					  Em
     love when things are doomed to failure
     Am   		  D7
     Turn out the lights and sleep alone
     G 			G7
     alone"

 // INTRO SECTION and VERSE 2 same chords

 	I used to know a guy when I was a kid
 	who always seemed to be angry
 	And I'd bury my nose in my book every time
 	that he threw a fit at school

 	Karen says, I should try to see that
 	some kids just have lots of problems
 	His cross to bear, and his parents
 	probably didn't love him.
 	Why should you waste all that
 	love when things are doomed to failure
 	Turn out the lights and sleep alone

// INSTRUMENTAL SECTION same chords as intro and verse

// No intro after the solo

	I used to have a friends who said he was sick
	but wouldn't go to the doctor
	And when he finally when they gave him
	less than six months left to live.

	"Well that sucks" karen says
	and tries to offer me some words of wisdom
	My friend is dead, or he's waiting for the
	death to kill him
	Why should you waste all that love
	when things are doomed to failure
	turn out the lights and sleep alone.
