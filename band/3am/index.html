    <h3>3am Lyrics</h3>
    She says it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat<br/>
    She's always worried about things like that<br/><br/>

    She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault<br/><br/>

    And she only sleeps when it's raining<br/>
    And she screams, and her voice is straining<br/><br/>
    And she says baby<br/>
    It's three a.m. I must be lonely<br/>
    When she says baby<br/>
    Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes<br/>
    And the rain's gonna wash away I believe it<br/><br/>
    She's got a little bit of something, god it's better than nothing<br/>
    And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all<br/>
    She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to<br/><br/>
    And she only sleeps when it's raining<br/>
    And she screams, and her voice is straining<br/><br/>
    And she says baby<br/>
    It's three a.m. I must be lonely<br/>
    Oh, when she says baby<br/>
    Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes<br/>
    And the rain's gonna wash away I believe this<br/><br/>
    She believes that life isn't made up of all that you're used to<br/>
    And the clock on the wall has been stuck at 3 for days, and days<br/>
    She thinks that happiness is the mat that sits on her doorway<br/>
    But outside it stopped raining<br/><br/>
    And she says baby<br/>
    It's three a.m. I must be lonely<br/>
    When she says baby<br/>
    Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes<br/>
    And the rain's gonna wash away I believe this<br/><br/>
    Well it's three a.m. I must be lonely<br/>
    Well hell, when she says baby<br/>
    Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes

Play the verse and chorus the same, listen to song for hammer ons, its mostly 
fifth string: 0h2, 4th string 0h2, open third. enjoy !


She's got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing 
And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all 
She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to 
And she only sleeps when it's raining 
And she screams and her voice is straining 

[chorus]

She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to 
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days 
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway 
But outside it's stopped raining 

[chorus]
