            Truthfully I long for the internet of my youth, the yet-to-be-monetized wild west of the 90s.
            Websites were often deliberately garish and it's an aesthetic I miss in these times of retina fonts and hero images.
            Every website back then was a labor of love.

            My goal for schwartz.world is to use it as a playground for my own experiments as
            a programmer. At work they expect pixel perfect, but that's not what you're going to find here. Instead my
            primary goals are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Accessibility</b> - primarily accomplished through the use of semantic server-generated HTML</li>
            <li><b>Speed</b> - The vast majority of the content will be server-generated static assets.
              JS and CSS will be minimal and hand-coded.</li>
            <li><b>Fun</b> - For me to build and for you to consume</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you feel like I've failed to meet any of those goals, I absolutely encourage you to drop in on <a
            href="https://github.com/ianschwartz/site">The Repo</a> and throw an issue or PR my way.

            My first computer was an Apple IIe when I was 7. I learned a little BASIC, but never made anything of value. I didn't have
            learning materials beyond simple intro stuff for kids, and I was a little on the young side for self-learning something as dense
            as programming. Having a computer at such a young age did give me a leg up in computer literacy. I typed all
            my reports long before anyone I knew.

            My father bought an IBM clone in the 90s and got a second phone line so we could use AOL. They used to charge
            by the minute then. I racked up some minutes, let me tell you. I learned a little HTML, but I couldn't figure out
            how to make my sites go live. During this time I also took a course in Visual Basic and another in C++ but I
            didn't stick with either.

            In 2014, I taught myself Ruby using <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org">Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial</a>.
            Rails is an amazing framework, but you still have to understand front-end to make a good app, and this became
            the bottleneck for me pretty quickly. In 2015, I switched my focus to JavaScript and front-end development and
            the rest is history!
